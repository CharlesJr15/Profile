        <p>My name is Charles Onah, I hold a 5-year bachelors degree in Industrial Chemistry, where programming was part of my curriculum.
          After graduation in 2023, I decided to advance my coding skills as Software Development student at Danfred Computer Engineering Ltd, where I learnt how to build modern,
          responsive, and scalable web applications. I have a growing passion for technology, problem-solving, and
          creating tools that make people’s lives easier. I’m gaining real-world experience by applying what I learn in
          class to personal projects, collaborative assignments, and hands-on coding challenges. I enjoy working with
          HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL and PHP and I’m also learning back-end technologies and version control tools like Git and
          GitHub. My goal is to become a full-stack developer, contribute to open-source projects, and one day build
          software that solves real problems in Africa and beyond, this is the initiative behind the establishment of CJTechs.</p><br><br>

              <p>Nigeria is a vibrant and diverse country located in West Africa, known for its rich cultural heritage
                and over 500 spoken languages. It is the most populous country in Africa and has a fast-growing economy
                fueled by industries like oil, agriculture, and technology. Nigeria is home to major cities such as
                Lagos, Abuja (the capital), and Kano, each offering unique contributions to the nation's identity. With
                its mix of tradition and innovation, Nigeria plays a key role in shaping Africa’s cultural and economic
                future.</p>
